# Crocus Documentation

Crocus (**Cro**ss **c**alendar **u**nification **s**oftware) is a unidirectional calendar synchronization tool.
It queries events from a set of event sources and then pushes them into a set of event sinks (or calendars).

This is the documentation on Crocus.
For a guide on how to get started, see the [Getting Started](./getting-started/install.md) section of this
 documentation.
For an overview over the Crocus core concepts and design decisions, see the [Architecture](./advanced/architecture.md)
 page.
