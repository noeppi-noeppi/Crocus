# Crocus

Crocus (**Cro**ss **c**alendar **u**nification **s**oftware) is a unidirectional calendar synchronization tool. It
queries events from a set of event sources and then pushes them into a set of event sinks (or calendars).

Key features of Crocus include:
- A Groovy-based configuration DSL for great flexibility and concise configuration.
- A plugin based architecture to easily add new types of event source and/or sinks via plugins.
- Incremental updates: Only upload events that changed since the last run to the target calendar.
